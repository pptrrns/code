# Personal code snippet library.

The library contains an extensive searchable collection of snippets in various programming languages. To read the snippets, you can use a code snippets manager, such as ``massCode`` or ``SnippetsLab``. 

#### massCode

``massCode`` is a  free and open-source code snippets manager for developers. It helps you create and organize your own personal snippet collection and have quick access to it.

- ``massCode`` supports extensions for ``VSCode``, so you can search for the necessary snippets and insert them immediately or save the selected code sections as a snippet.
- Check out the massCode [user documentation](https://masscode.io/documentation/)
- ``db.json`` contains all snippets.
